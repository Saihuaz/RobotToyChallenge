# Toy Robot Simulator

My Java implementation of the Toy Robot coding challenge.

## Requirements
- Java 17+
- Gradle 7.0+

## How to Run

1. Extract the files to a directory
2. Run `./gradlew build` to build the project
3. Run `./gradlew run` to start the application
4. Run `./gradlew test` to run unit tests

The solution should handles edge cases like invalid placements and prevents the robot from falling off the table. 
The tests cover all the required functionality from the challenge description.
